# Automatic-Graph-Representation-Algorithm-AGRA-
This repository provides code for a data Processing algorithm to extract geometric structures from SQL dbs (ASE dbs), convert them into torch geometric graph objects, and train on a range of Graph Neural Networks. The graph representation algorithm is then compared against the open catalyst project (OCPs) graph generation class AtomsToGraph. Our algorithm is observed to improve performance at a large reduction in computational cost thanks to a different approach to edge generation, feature embedding and node classification.
